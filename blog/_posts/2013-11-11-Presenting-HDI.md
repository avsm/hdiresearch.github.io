First public outing for HDI garners a best paper award!

Having serialised our thoughts into the [Tech Report][hdi-tr], we thought it
would be a good idea to give them a public airing so to speak. So we did,
submitting [an extended abstract][hdi-paper] to the [Digital Economy All-hands
meeting 2013][de2013]. Now in it's fourth year, this is the annual meeting of
the [RCUK Digital Economy
Programme](http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/research/xrcprogrammes/Digital/Pages/home.aspx),
and a good chance to meet up with like-minded folk.

      We were accepted for presentation with some pretty favourable reviews and
      so, last Monday (November 4th) we were the first research presentation up
      at this year's meeting in Salford. As the first research presentation
      following several keynote presentations, the audience were still warming
      up but we still had some good questions and subsequent discussions over
      drinks at the very fine technical demonstrator session (disclaimer: I
      organised it :)
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Tuesday evening I was even more pleased to discover that we'd been
      awarded one of the best paper awards (the others were the best student
      paper, &ldquo;<a
      href="http://de2013.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/de2013_submission_51.pdf">Designing
      e-Voting for Participation: methodology</a>&rdquo; and one other best
      paper, &ldquo;<a
      href="http://de2013.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/de2013_submission_28.pdf">CURIOS:
      Connecting Community Heritage through Linked Data</a>&rdquo;.
    </p>

      As the presenter, I (of course) claimed the prize associated with the
      award: a shiny new Nexus 7 mini-tablet -- very nice! First impressions
      after being an iPad user for a few months is that it's a useful form
      factor, Android has improved significantly since the (rather old) version
      on my Samsung Galaxy SII phone, and I probably prefer it to iOS even
      though I've not yet upgraded to iOS7. (Read that as you will :)

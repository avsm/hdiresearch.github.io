Welcome!

We're a group of independent researchers who came together because of a shared interest in _Human-Data Interaction_ or HDI. Stemming from a discussion between [Richard Mortier][mort] and [Hamed Haddadi][hamed], the essence of HDI is to _empower users to understand and control the increasingly pervasive collection and analysis of data about and by them_. We believe this is an exciting and highly relevant research agenda -- we look forward to having you join us as it develops!
